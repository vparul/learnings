/*

What tools and techniques do you use for debugging JavaScript code?

1. Using console methods - 
 - console.log() - This is the very basic method of inspecting variables, data structures in the code.
 - console.error() - This prints the error in the console with more info and stack traces.
 - console.warn() - Displays warning
 - console.table() -  Displays data in tabular format


 2. Using degugger keyword 
 You can add the degugger keyword in the code and the code execution stops where it encounter this keyword and from there you can understand the code flow and 
 see line by line code execution.


 3. Using breakpoints 
 You can add breakpoints in the browser ( network tab) or in the IDE and the code will stop the execution at the breakpoint and from tehre you can 
 start debugging the code

 4. Performance Tab 
 You can analyse the CPU consumption, rendering times, memory allocation and can identify the performance bottlenack (performance tab in browser)
