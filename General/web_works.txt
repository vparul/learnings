When you type a website like www.google.com in your browser, several steps happen:

1. DNS Lookup

- The browser needs the server’s IP address.
- DNS (Domain Name System) converts the domain name (www.google.com) into an IP address (like 142.250.193.206).
- This is similar to looking up a contact name in your phone to get the phone number.

2. Connect to the Server

- Once the IP address is known, the browser connects to that server.

3. HTTPS Security Setup
- The browser and the server create a secure connection.
- HTTPS makes sure the communication is encrypted and safe.

4. Request and Response
- The browser requests the webpage.
- The server sends back HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.

5. Browser Shows the Page
- The browser reads all the files and displays the webpage to the user.
