// // A high level language is a language which is easy for human to read abd write without worrying about how the tasks are
// perfomed in the background.

// It is like writing console.log("Hello"). Here, you just told the computer what to do without worrying about how it would be done.

// Whereas, in low level language, you hav to give the exact instructions to the computer to perform any action.

// Like, in high level, let's say you are giving intruction to a robot to make tea but in low level, you have to exactly say take vessel, turn stove, put wanter in the vessel, add tea boil
