SQL  (RDBMS) - SQL stands for structured Query Language. Used to retrieve, manage and update data in the database.

SQL Query - Data from database is retrieved with the help of SQL queries.

Types of SQL queries - 
1. Data Query Language [DQL] 
This is the most common type. It is used exclusively to fetch or retrieve data without changing it.

SELECT: The primary command to pull data.

Example: SELECT name, email FROM users;

2. Data manipulation Language [DML]
These commands are used to modify the actual data stored inside the tables.

INSERT: Adds new rows.
UPDATE: Edits existing rows.
DELETE: Removes rows.

Example: UPDATE products SET price = 20 WHERE id = 101;

3. Data Definition Language [DDL]
DDL is used to define or change the structure (schema) of the database itself—like creating or destroying the "filing cabinets."

CREATE: Creates a new table or database.
ALTER: Modifies the structure (e.g., adding a new column).
DROP: Deletes an entire table or database.
TRUNCATE: Empties a table but keeps the structure.

4. Data Control Language [DCL]
Used by administrators to manage security and permissions.

GRANT: Gives a user permission to do something.
REVOKE: Takes a permission away.

5. Transaction Control Language [TCL]
Manages the flow of work. Since DML changes are often temporary until "finalized," TCL ensures everything stays consistent.

COMMIT: Saves all changes permanently.
ROLLBACK: Undoes changes if an error occurs.
SAVEPOINT: Creates a "checkpoint" to return to later.
