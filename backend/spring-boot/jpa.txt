JPA stands for Jakarta Persistance API and it's a specification that helps Java application store, retrieve, update and delete data in the database 
without writing complex SQL queries.

Why people think JPA is a framework
Because we usually use JPA through a framework.

| Type                       | Name            |
| ---------------------------| --------------- |
| Specification              | JPA             |
| Framework / Implementation | Hibernate       |
| Framework using JPA        | Spring Data JPA |


In Spring Boot, When you use: spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
You get:
- JPA specification
- Hibernate as the default implementation
- Spring Data abstractions on top

Your code → Spring Data JPA → JPA spec → Hibernate → Database

Advantages of JPA -
1. Easy and simple 
2. Make queries easier. It helps us write queries in the form of entities rather than SQL.
3. Allows to save and update objects
4. Easy integration with springboot
 
Why JPA need no args construtor?
JPA providers like Hiberate uses Reflection to instantiate entity objects. Reflection either needs a public or a protected no args constructor to instantiate
the entity object .
Without this JPA won't be able to create objects for the entity class while reading the data from database.

Reflection - Reflection in Java is a powerful feature that allows code to inspect and manipulate itself at runtime.
Reflection lets your program:
 - Look inside classes, interfaces, fields, and methods while the program is running.
 - Create objects, call methods, or change fields — even if you don’t know the class at compile time.
 - Java provides a built-in API for reflection in the java.lang.reflect package.

Downsides of Reflection:
 - Slower performance than regular code.
 - Breaks encapsulation (can access private members).
 - More error-prone — errors only show up at runtime.

 JPA uses reflection to:
 - Create entity objects from database rows (via no-args constructor).
 - Set private fields when loading data.
 - Call getter/setter methods for mapping.
