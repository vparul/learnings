Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by analysing the data it produces - like logs, metric & traces

Monitoring vs Observability

Monitoring - Watching system health and performance. Ex - Checking if the server is running
Observability - Understanding why things happened. Ex - Debugging why a request failed

Logs - 
Logs are text based records of events happening in a system.
Tools - ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstach, kibana)

Ex - In a food delivery app, a log might look like - 
[2025-01-19 12:00:15] INFO OrderService: Order ID 1234 placed successfully;
[2025-01-19 12:00:20] ERROR PaymentService: Payment failed for Order ID 1234


Metrics - 
Metrics are numerical values that help track system performace over time.

Tools - Prometheus + grafana

Ex - in a video streaming app, some imporant metrics are: 
CPU usage: 80% (Is system overloaded?)
Response Time: 500ms (Are users experiencing delays?)

Traces - 
Traces track how a request moves across multiple microservices.
Tools - Zipkin, Jaeger
Ex- In a ride sharing app, when a user books a reide, the request passes through :
User service (Verify user)
Ride Service (Find available riders)
Payment Servuce (Process payment)
Notification Service (Send confirmation)
