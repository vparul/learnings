Q - Why it is recommdended to have a service interface and a service impl class in springboot?
A - 
    If not used, controller will be tightly coupled with the service.
    Service interfaces in Spring Boot are used to achieve loose coupling, support multiple implementations, improve testability, and follow SOLID principles - 
    but they are optional and should be used when flexibility is needed
