Repository is an interface that lets us communicate with database without wrirting SQL queries. 
It acts as a middleman between the Java code and the database.

Example - 
@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    // Here User is the entity Class & Long is the type of primary Key
}

Why do we need a repository  ?
1. No boilerplate code -  Without this we have to write a lot of SQL codes that is no longer needed when dealing with repository.
2. Reuseability - It provides a lot of methods like save, finById etc which can be used across multiple services.
3. Seperation of concerns - Each layer has a single responsibility i.e 
    controller -> handles all HTTP requests
    entity -> DB table represenattion
    service -> contains business logic
    repository -> DB communication


CrudRepository vs JpaRepository

CruuRepository -> It provides methods that supports only CRUD operations (Create, read, update & delete)
ex - findAll(), findById(), save(), delete() etc.

JpaRepository -> It provides Crud Operations plus jpa specific operations as well. So, it is an extansion of CrudRepository
Ex -> 1. Sorting (findAll(Sort sort)), Pagination (findAll(Pageable pageable)), Batch entries (saveAll()), Flush etc(saveAllAndFlush())

syntax -> 
public class UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long>{}
public class UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long>{}
