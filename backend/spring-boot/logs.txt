Spring boot doesn’t log message directly.
 
 CODE [logger.info("Message")] ---> SLF4J (Logging Facade) [Acts as a middleman] ---> Logging Framework (Logback (default)etc) ---> Log output [Console, file, etc]

 SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) - Interface (middleman) for logging, It forwards logs to the actual logging framework.

 Logback (Default in Spring Boot) - Processes logs, applies formatting, filtering and decides where to send logs

 Log output - The final destination for logs (Console, File, Database, etc)

Log Monitoring system --> Loki + Grafana , Kibana + EleasticSearch etc


By default, Springboot logs only Warn, error and info logs. If you want to see debug, trace logs as well, you need to change the application configuration.

in application.properties file 
logging.level.root: TRACE -> This setting will enable all the logs (trace, debug, warn, error and info)
logging.level.root: INFO -> remaining will have this log setting
logging.level.com.ecommerce.user: TRACE -> All details logs will have this config that comes under this folder
