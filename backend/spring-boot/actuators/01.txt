Spring boot actuators are built in tools that helps us manage our applications in production. It gives us some endpoint 
to manage our application for health-check, environment properties, CPU utilisation etc.
You can use tools like grafana etc for monitoring purposes.

Once you just add the Actuator dependency in Spring Boot (without exposing anything extra), the default behavior is:
👉 It exposes only one endpoint: http://localhost:8080/actuator

this endpoint returns a JSON response listing which actuator endpoints are currently available and exposed over HTTP.

For example, the response typically looks like:

{
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/actuator",
      "templated": false
    },
    "health": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/actuator/health",
      "templated": false
    }
  }
}


📝 Explanation:
self → link to the actuator root itself.
health → is the only exposed endpoint by default, so you can also visit: http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

and see something like:
{
  "status": "UP"
}


For exposing all the endpoints, you can add the following configurations in the application.properties file
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
- This will expose all the endpoints that might include some sensitive data so make sure to expose few APIs in production ready application. In development mode, exposing all won;t affect anything

If you want to just expose one or two endpoint, you can do it by adding the following in application.properties file
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=shutdown,health,beans

---------------------------------------SOME COMMON ENDPOINTS--------------------------------------------------

1. /actuator/health - 
This endpoint tell the overall health of the application. This is used for monitoring purposes. This tells whether your application is running correctly or not.

This endpoint by default share the status of the application in json format - 
{ status: "UP" }

if you wan to get the overall information of the application, you can set the property in application.properties file
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always

This will expose all the details of the application like DB status, ssl status, disk status etc some of which can be sensitive. So, it is 
not recommended to use always in production application.

You can set other values - 
1. always - discussed above
2. never - (Default in production) Don’t show any health details — only status.
3. when-authorized - Show details only if the user is authorized (has correct role).


2. /actuator/info - 

This endpoint exposes the arbitary information about your application like build time, app version, app description, name etc.
It is commonly used by CI/CD pipelines, dashboards etc for application metadata.

If no info is set, by default, it returns empty json object.

for enabling it - management.endpoint.info.enabled=true
Let's say your application.properties file has the following configuration - 
info.app.name=My Spring Boot App
info.app.version=1.0.3
info.app.description=Demo of actuator info endpoint
info.company.name=Acme Inc

So, /actuator/info will return the following json object - 
{
  "app": {
    "name": "My Spring Boot App",
    "version": "1.0.3",
    "description": "Demo of actuator info endpoint"
  },
  "company": {
    "name": "Acme Inc"
  }
}


3. /actuator/metrics - 
This endpoint exposes the application performance and system metries like 
JVM memory usage
CPU load
HTTP request statistics
GC activity
Thread count
Datasource metrics etc

You can see the list of the metric name by hitting the endpoint - http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics

{
  "names": [
    "jvm.memory.used",
    "jvm.memory.max",
    "jvm.gc.memory.allocated",
    "jvm.threads.live",
    "system.cpu.usage",
    "process.uptime",
    "http.server.requests",
    "logback.events",
    "tomcat.sessions.active",
    ...
  ]
}

then let's say you want to see jvm.memory.used -> you have to hit the endpoint http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.used

4. /actuator/loggers
This endpoint exposes the current log levels for all the packages/ classes without restarting the applictaion.

GET /actuator/loggers
Shows all loggers and their current effective levels (INFO, DEBUG, etc.)
{
  "levels": ["OFF", "ERROR", "WARN", "INFO", "DEBUG", "TRACE"],
  "loggers": {
    "root": {
      "configuredLevel": "INFO",
      "effectiveLevel": "INFO"
    },
    "com.yourapp": {
      "configuredLevel": null,
      "effectiveLevel": "INFO"
    }
  }
}

If you want to change the log level dynamically, you have to got to postman and change the type from get to post and add body and hit 
POST /actuator/loggers/com.yourapp.service

{
  "configuredLevel": "DEBUG"
}

you will get the result as - 
{
  "effectiveLevel": "DEBUG",
  "configuredLevel": "DEBUG"
}

configuredLevel -> the log level set explicitly
effectiveLevel -> the initial log level


5. /actuator/beans
This endpoint lists all the beans in the Spring ApplicationContext, including:
Bean name
Bean type
Scope
Dependencies

This is useful for debugging what Spring has actually instantiated. It can produce very large output — so be careful in production.


6. /actuator/shutdown
This endpoint lets you shut down the application gracefully( this means that it will first complete all the request and then will sht down the application).
This is not enabled by default as this is a very risky endpoint.

For enabling - 
management.endpoint.shutdown.enabled=true

You must send a POST request (GET not supported):
POST /actuator/shutdown
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/actuator/shutdown

{
  "message": "Shutting down, bye..."
}

Then the app will terminate cleanly.
This should be secured heavily or used only in internal/admin tools. Never expose this publicly.
