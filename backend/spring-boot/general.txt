What is Spring Boot?
- Spring Boot is a open source java based framework used to create stand alone production grade spring based applications.
Spring vs Spring Boot - 
 With Spring, lots of steps involved in setting up, configuration, writing bolierplate code and deployment of the applications
 but
 With Spring Boot, offers a set of pre configured components or default and elimibtaing the need for a lot of boilerplate code that was involved in setting up the strping applications

 Spring boot = spring framework + prebuilt configuration + embedded servers


 Components of the Spring boot - 
 1. Spring boot starters 

 Spring Boot Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your Spring Boot application. 
 This provide all the necessary libraries, dependencies, and configurations for a specific functionality, like web development, data access, security, etc.

 ✅ Key Idea: Instead of manually searching for and adding dozens of dependencies to your pom.xml or build.gradle, 
Starters bundle commonly used ones together into a single, easy-to-use package.

🔧 Example
If you're building a web application, instead of adding:

<dependency>spring-web</dependency>
<dependency>spring-webmvc</dependency>
<dependency>jackson-databind</dependency>
<dependency>tomcat-embed-core</dependency>


You just add:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>


This one starter brings in all the necessary dependencies for building a Spring MVC web application.

📦 Common Spring Boot Starters

spring-boot-starter	- Core starter with basic Spring Boot setup
spring-boot-starter-web	- Web apps using Spring MVC, REST, and Tomcat
spring-boot-starter-data-jpa- 	For working with databases using Spring Data JPA
spring-boot-starter-security - 	Adds Spring Security for authentication and authorization
spring-boot-starter-test - 	Testing dependencies like JUnit, Mockito, Spring Test, etc.

2. Auto Configuration in Spring Boot

Spring Boot's auto-configuration automatically configures your application based on the dependencies on the classpath and the beans you define.

🔧 How it works:
When you include a dependency (like spring-boot-starter-web), Spring Boot sees this and automatically configures related beans like DispatcherServlet, Jackson for JSON, Tomcat server, etc.
You don’t need to write configuration classes manually for every component — Spring Boot does it for you.

🛠 Example:

If you include:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>

Spring Boot:

- Configures a DataSource
- Sets up JPA EntityManager
- Enables Spring Data Repositories
- Applies Hibernate properties (based on application.properties)

🚨 Can you override it?
Yes! You can override any auto-configuration by defining your own @Bean.

3. Spring Boot Actuator

Spring Boot Actuator adds production-ready monitoring and management features to your app with minimal effort.

📦 Dependency:
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>

🧠 What does it provide?

It exposes REST endpoints to monitor and manage your app, like:

/actuator/health - Check app health (e.g., DB, disk, etc.)
/actuator/info	- App metadata (version, description)
/actuator/metrics - 	JVM memory, threads, CPU, etc.
/actuator/env	- Current environment properties


4. Embedded Server in Spring Boot
Spring Boot comes with an embedded server, so you don’t need to deploy your app to an external server (like Tomcat or Jetty).

🔧 Default Behavior:
Tomcat is embedded by default (via spring-boot-starter-web)
Alternatives: Jetty, Undertow (can be switched)


✅ Advantages of Spring Boot
- Fast Development – Quickly build Spring applications with minimal setup.
- Auto Configuration – Automatically configures beans and settings based on your dependencies.
- Embedded Server – No need for external server (Tomcat, Jetty); runs as a standalone JAR.
- Starter Dependencies – Bundled dependencies make it easy to get started.
- Production-Ready – Comes with Actuator for health checks, metrics, and monitoring.
- Less Boilerplate Code – Minimal XML/config files needed.
- Great for Microservices – Lightweight and easy to containerize (Docker, Kubernetes).
- Easy Integration – Supports integration with databases, security, cloud, etc.

❌ Disadvantages of Spring Boot
- Less Control – Auto-configuration may hide internal behavior.
- Large JAR Size – Includes embedded server and unused dependencies.
- Harder to Debug – Issues with auto-configuration can be tricky to troubleshoot.
- Not Ideal for All Apps – May not suit large, complex enterprise applications.
- Performance Overhead – Might load unnecessary components if not optimized.
- Learning Curve – Beginners may struggle to understand what’s happening behind the scenes.



SPRING BOOT ARCHITECTURE - 
- Spring boot has layered architecture where one layer communicates with another layer (tier) and their are few layers that exists in the spring boot application.
- Following are the main layers - 
1. Presentation layer
2. Service layer
3. Data access layer


PRESENTATION LAYER -  Presentation layer presents the data and the application features to the user. This is tha layer where in all the controller classes exists.
Controller accept the request from the user, validates the input that the user has given and passes it to the next layer, i.e. service layer.

SERVICE LAYER - Service layer is where the business logic resides in the application. Tasks such as evaluation, decision making, processing of data
is done at this layer. This layer also does the job of interacting with both the presentation layer & data access layer. 

DATA ACCESS LAYER - Data access layer is the layer where all the repository classes resides. These repository classes are responsible for interacting with the databases like performing the 
CRUD operations 

PRESENTATION -----> SERVICE ------> DATA ACCESS 




EXAMPLE  - 
BROWSER -----> CONTROLLER ---> SERVICE ---> REPOSTORY ----> DATABASE (and once the data has been fetched from the cycle) , 
data flow from DATABASE ---> REPOSTORY ---> SERVICE ---> CONTROLLER ----> BROWSER

If you want to see all the SQL queries being executed while running the application, you have to add the following command in application.properties file
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
