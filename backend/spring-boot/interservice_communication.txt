Inter-service communication refers to how microservices talk to each other.
In Spring Boot microservices, there are multiple patterns depending on whether communication is synchronous, asynchronous, direct, or through a broker.

- TWO MAIN TYPES OF INTER-SERVICE COMMUNICATION

1️. Synchronous communication (Request–Response): The caller waits for the response.

Common options:
- REST (HTTP)

- RestTemplate (deprecated for new dev)
-  WebClient
- RestClient
- Http interfaces
- OpenFeign (best for declarative calls)

2. Asynchronous communication (Event-driven): Caller does NOT wait for response.

Common options:
RabbitMQ
Kafka
AWS SNS/SQS
Google Pub/Sub
Event streaming with Kafka
