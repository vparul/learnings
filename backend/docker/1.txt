What is docker?
Docker is a tool that helps developers run applications in isolated boxes called containers.
Each container has everything your app needs — code, libraries, system tools, etc. — so it works the same way everywhere (on your laptop, on someone else’s machine, or on a server).

Why do we need Docker:
Without Docker:
An app might work on your computer but fail on another because of missing libraries, OS differences, or version mismatches (“It works on my machine” problem).

With Docker:
- You package your app with all its dependencies → it runs anywhere, exactly the same.
- You can run multiple apps on the same machine without conflicts.
- It’s faster and lighter than virtual machines.
- It makes deployment, testing, and scaling much easier.


Architecture of Docker - 
1. Docker Client (CLI) - The end user give commands to the docker through the docker client. Its like giving orders what to do
The commands are like - 
Docker run
Docker build 

etc ..

The client sends the commands to  Docker Daemon(the service which do the real work)

2. Docker Engine (Docker Host)
It contains 2 main parts - 
1. Docker Daemon
2. Containers & Images

Docker Daemon - 
- This runs in the background and wait for instructions from the CLI.
- It is kind of brain of docker 
- It do the following things - 
    a. Push/ pull docker images from the registry
    b. Manages Networks & Volumns 
    c. Build docker images 
    d. Run containers

Docker Images - 
This is a read-only template or blueprint used to create containers.
It includes the application code, dependencies, libraries etc.
You usually define an image using a Dockerfile (explained below).

Example:
node:18 → official Node.js image
ubuntu:latest → Ubuntu OS image

Docker Containers - A container is a running instance of a Docker image.
You can have multiple containers from the same image.
Each container is isolated but shares the same OS kernel → that’s what makes Docker lightweight.
You can start, stop, remove, or restart containers anytime.

Docker Networking - Docker provides virtual networks to allow containers to talk to each other or the outside world.

Common types:
bridge → default, connects containers on same host
host → shares host network
none → fully isolated

Networking lets containers communicate safely.

Docker Volumes - Containers are temporary; when they stop, data inside them is lost.

Volumes are used to store data permanently outside containers.
Volume = A folder to save data that lives even after container stops.

3. Docker Registry

A Docker Registry is a storage hub for images.
The most common one is Docker Hub.
You can also create private registries (like your own image store).


Dockerfile — The Heart of Docker Images

A Dockerfile is a simple text file with instructions to build an image.

Example:
# Step 1: Start from a base image
FROM node:18

# Step 2: Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy code to container
COPY . .

# Step 4: Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Step 5: Run the app
CMD ["npm", "start"]



🧩How Everything Works Together

Here’s the step-by-step flow:
1️⃣ You write a Dockerfile
2️⃣ You build an Image using `docker build`
3️⃣ The Image is stored locally or in a Registry
4️⃣ You run a Container using `docker run`
5️⃣ The Container executes your app in an isolated environment
