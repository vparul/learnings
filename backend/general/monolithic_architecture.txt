monolithic Architecture is when an entire application is build an a single program. All the features (cart, payment, user) etc packed and run as a single program.
Structure - 
mono_repo 
    -> src
         -> frontend (React , angualr etc)
         -> backend (business logics, APIs, services)
         -> database (models, migrations, database scripts)
         -> shared (utils, config)
    -> package.json
    -> readme.md
    -----

Disadvantages - 
1. Difficult to scale. Since, you cannot scale a single file, you have to scale the entire application
2. You are stuck with a initial tech stack for a long Period 
3. It becomes difficult to maintain the project as any change would require you to redeploy the entire application
4. If you have a large team working on the same project, it would be difficult to maintain code changes etc

Advantages - 
1. Prefered if you are building a quick small MVPs
2. When you team is small
3. Things are tightly coupled
