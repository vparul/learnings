// What is an API?
// API stands for Application Programming Interface
// Set of rules and protocols that allow one software applicatiion to interact and communicate with another.

// Why do we need APIs?
// - Share data - APIs allow one software application to communicate with another and share data
// - Speed up development - Developer can consume the already written functionality which speed up the development
// - Extend the reach and functionality of software - If you are company, you can sell your APIs to third party to untilise those 

// Types of API - 
// 1. Internal APIs - 
// These are the APIs that are created for the internal use. Some other team of the same company expose the API that other team can be used by 
// other teams of the same company. These APIs are not supposed to expose to the outside world

// 2. External APIs - 
// These are public APIs which are exposed to the world. Some examples are Twitter API, Google APIs etc

// 3. Patner APIs  -
// These are the APIs which are created for the partners of the organization. These are only exposed for that particualr partner and not for the rest of the world.



Types of API Requests - 
1. GET 
 - Retieve or Get resources from server
 - Only use to READ data

2. POST
 - Create resources on server 

3. PUT
  - Update resources on server

4. DELETE 
  - Use to delete resources from the server 

----------------------------------------------- REST API ------------------------------------------------------------------------
REST API, stands for Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API).
- REST is stateless - Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information server needs to understand the request.
- Server do not store any data of the client.

Priciple of REST API - 
1. Client-server architecture 
- The client (browser, mobile app, frontend) asks for data.
- The server (backend) stores data and handles logic.
- They are separate, so each can be changed without affecting the other.


2. Stateless

- The server does not remember anything about the previous request.
- Every request must contain all the information the server needs.

3. Can be cached

- Responses from the server can be saved temporarily to make things faster.
- If the data doesn’t change often, you don’t need to ask the server again.

4. Opaque in terms of layers

- The client doesn’t know how many layers exist between it and the server.
- There might be proxies, load balancers, security layers, etc.

Example:
When you call an API, you have no idea if your request is going directly to the server or passing through 5 other systems.
But it still works the same.
