microservice Architecture is when an application is build as the collection of small, independent services, each responsible for a single business logic.

each service will have - 
1. Its own codebase
2. Can develop, deploy as a independent single unit
3. Each service can communicate with other services through rest calls (REST API)

When to use microservice Architecture - 
1. When you have a large team working parallely
2. When you have a large application with multiple domains (payment, user, inventory etc)
3. You need independent Scalability
4. You want flexibility in technology choices.

Advantages - 
1. Scale only what’s needed (e.g., just the order service).
2. If one service fails, others keep working.
3. Teams can build and deploy independently.
4. Use different languages or databases for each service.
5. Deploy or roll back individual services.

Disadvantages - 
1. Many moving parts, hard to monitor and debug.
2. Network latency between services.
3. Needs DevOps setup (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.).
4. Harder to maintain data consistency across services.
5. More infrastructure and management overhead.

Amazon, Netflix, and Uber use microservices
