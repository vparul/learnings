// What is an API?
// API stands for Application Programming Interface
// Set of rules and protocols that allow one software applicatiion to interact and communicate with another.

// Why do we need APIs?
// - Share data - APIs allow one software application to communicate with another and share data
// - Speed up development - Developer can consume the already written functionality which speed up the development
// - Extend the reach and functionality of software - If you are company, you can sell your APIs to third party to untilise those 

// Types of API - 
// 1. Internal APIs - 
// These are the APIs that are created for the internal use. Some other team of the same company expose the API that other team can be used by 
// other teams of the same company. These APIs are not supposed to expose to the outside world

// 2. External APIs - 
// These are public APIs which are exposed to the world. Some examples are Twitter API, Google APIs etc

// 3. Patner APIs  -
// These are the APIs which are created for the partners of the organization. These are only exposed for that particualr partner and not for the rest of the world.
