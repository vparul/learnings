What is Postgres?
Postgres is an open source relational database which is popluar for its powerful features.
It uses SQL for managing and querying data.

⚙️ When to use PostgreSQL

✅ Complex queries and relationships between data (e.g., multiple tables with joins).
✅ Strict data integrity( Data integrity ensures your data is correct, complete, and doesn’t get changed accidentally or incorrectly.) 
(banking, healthcare, ERP systems, etc.).
✅ Scalability and reliability for large datasets.
✅ Open-source + enterprise-level performance.


🚀 When not to use PostgreSQL
- You’re building a small, quick MVP with few data relations → use SQLite.
- You need ultra-fast reads with simple schema → MySQL might be better.
- You need a schema-less, document-first approach → consider MongoDB.
