What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled React Components?

🎛️ 1. Controlled Components

A controlled component is one where React controls the form data via state.
That means the input’s value (or checked state) is always determined by React state.

✅ Example: Controlled Input
import { useState } from "react";

function ControlledExample() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={name}              // ← Controlled by React state
        onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} // ← Updates state
      />
      <p>Hello, {name}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

🧠 What’s Happening:
value={name} → React decides what’s displayed in the input.
When you type, onChange updates state, and React re-renders with the new value.
The source of truth is React state, not the DOM.

✅ Pros:
You can easily validate, modify, or reset data.
Works well with forms where you need to control or submit the input data.

⚠️ Cons:
Slightly more code.
Each keystroke re-renders the component (usually fine).

🕹️ 2. Uncontrolled Components
An uncontrolled component is one where the DOM itself controls the form data, not React.
You read the value using a ref when needed instead of React state.

✅ Example: Uncontrolled Input
import { useRef } from "react";

function UncontrolledExample() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    alert(`Name: ${inputRef.current.value}`); // Access value from DOM
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />  {/* No state, uncontrolled */}
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </div>
  );
}

🧠 What’s Happening:

The input manages its own internal state (like normal HTML).
You only access the value when needed via ref.
React doesn’t re-render when the input value changes.

✅ Pros:
Simpler for non-dynamic forms.
Can be slightly faster (no re-renders on typing).

⚠️ Cons:
Harder to validate or modify inputs dynamically.
You can’t easily reset or track live changes.
