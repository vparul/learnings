Pitfalls about using context in React
- Performance issues
 One of the main pitfalls of using context in React is the potential for performance issues. 
 When the context value changes, all components that consume the context will re-render, even if they don't use the part of the context that changed. 
 This can lead to unnecessary re-renders and degrade the performance of your application.

- Debugging difficulties
 Debugging issues related to context can be challenging. 
 Since context updates can trigger re-renders in multiple components, it can be difficult to trace the source of a bug or performance issue. 
 This is especially true in larger applications with many context providers and consumers.
