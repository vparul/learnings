State is the component's memory. State is a way to store and manage data that can change over the component's lifecycle. 
It allows the developer to - 
1. Update the component's view by re-rendering.  Updating component state trigger react to re render the component.
2. Persist local variable between renders.

In function component, we declare the state using useState hook - 
  const [step, setStep] = useState(0); // 0 is the default value. You can also leave it empty


Ques - Why doesn’t React re-render when I do count = count + 1 instead of using setCount?
Ans - 
When we write:
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
React creates an internal state, and count is just a copy of that state at the time of rendering.

When we do: count = count + 1;

we’re only updating the local variable, not React’s internal state.
Since React doesn’t know about this change, it won’t re-render.

But when we use: setCount(count + 1);
we update React’s internal state, which tells React that a state change has happened.
React then triggers a re-render with the updated value.
