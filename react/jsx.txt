- JSX is a declarative syntax to describe what components look like
- Components must return a block of JSX
- JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension of JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
- Browser does not understand JSX so, it convert JSX into javascript using a tool Babel (automatically included while creating project from create react app),
ex- 
<header>
    <h1 style="color: red>
        Hello React !!
    </h1>
</header>

This code will be converted into something like - 

React.createElement(
    'header',
    null,
    React.createElement(
        'h1',
        { style: { color: 'red' } },
        'Hello React !!'
    )
);

- You can use React without JSX.  


What do you mean by JSX is declarative?

👉 You describe what the UI should look like,
❌ not how to build or update it step by step.

🧠 Example (Declarative — JSX)
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
}


You just declare:
“I want an h1 that says Hello World.”
✅ React figures out how to render it, where to put it in the DOM, and how to update it if data changes.

🛠️ Example (Imperative — Vanilla JS)

const h1 = document.createElement("h1");
h1.textContent = "Hello World";
document.getElementById("root").appendChild(h1);

Here, you tell the browser:
“Create an element, set its text, find a parent, and append it.”
You’re controlling every step manually.

🪄 Why Declarative is better
 - Easier to read and maintain
 - React automatically updates the UI when state changes
 - You focus on what the UI should be, not DOM manipulation

📝 In short:
“Declarative” = Describe the end result.
“Imperative” = Tell the system exactly what to do step by step.


Rules of JSX - 
1. A piece of JSX can only return a single root element. If you want to return, you can use<></> or React.Fragment
2. You can write any piece of JS expression inside JSX enclosed in {}
3. But you cannot have any if else or switch statement .
