Props are the communication channel between the parent and the child component. We pass the data from the parent component to the child component with the help of props
Parent component state is actually the prop for the child component.

const Parent = () => {
    return (
        <Child name="hello" />
    )
}

const Child = (props) => { // you can destructure here as well
    const { name } = props
    return (
        <div>{name}</div>
    )
}

- We can pass anything in props like array, object, boolean , component etc
- Props are read-only. You cannot change the value of props from the child component. Hence, props are immutable
- If you want to change the value of props, it can only be donw by changing the state of the parent component.
- Why props are immutable ? Mutating the props will affect the parent component creating the side effect which will make the component impure.
- components have to be pure so that react can optimise apps, avoid bugs and make app predictable.

Pure component is 
- It always renders the same output when given the same name.
- It doesn’t modify anything outside itself (like global variables, DOM, etc)
