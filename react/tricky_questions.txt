❌ Why writing {Tab()} (any component) inside JSX is not advisable

In React, components should be rendered using JSX syntax (<Tab />) and not called like regular functions ({Tab()}).
When you write:
{Tab()} 
1. React treats Tab as a normal JavaScript function, not as a component.
This means React loses control over how the component is rendered and updated.
Correct way: <Tab />

2. Calling Tab() runs the function every time the parent renders, so:
State can reset
Effects may re-run incorrectly
React can only preserve state when it owns the component instance.
