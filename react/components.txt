- React applications are entirely made of the components.
- Components are the building blocks of the user interfaces in React.
- Piece of UI that has its own logic, data and appearance (how it works & looks).
- We build complex UI by building multiple components and combining them.
- Components can be reused, nested inside each other and pass data between them.



How to split the component?
1. Logical separation of content / layout 
   - Does the component contain pieces of content or layout that doesn't belong together?

2. Reusability - 
  - Is it possible to reuse part of the component?
  - Do you want or need to reuse it?

3. Responsibilities / complexity 

  - Is the component doing too many things?
  - Does the component rely on too many props?
  - Does the component have too many piece of state or effects?
  - Is the code, including JSX, too complex/confusing?

4. Personal coding styles


Usually components lies in the following 3 categories - 
1. Stateless / presentational component - logo 
2. Stateful components - List of data
3. Structural components - Pages, layouts, screens



Component Composition - Combining different components using the children props for explicitly defined props.

With Component composition, we can,
1. Create highly reusanle and flexible components.
2. Fix prop drilling (great for layout)

Component vs Component Instance vs Element - 


COMPONENT - 

A component is the function that returns react elements (element tree), Usually written in JSX.
It kind of a blueprint or "Template"


COMPONENT INSTANCE - 
- Instances are created when we "use" the component.
- If we call the component, 3 times, 3 instances will be created that will have their own state and props


ELEMENT - 

- JSX is converted to React.createElement() function call.
- A react element is the result of these function calls, (createElement returns a JS object which is react element)
- Information is necessary to create DOM elements
- A React element is just a description of what should appear on the screen. It is NOT the actual HTML yet.

COMPONENT ---> COMPONENT INSTANCE ----> (Return) REACT ELEMENT ----> (inserted into DOM) DOM Element (HTML) [through ReactDOM]
