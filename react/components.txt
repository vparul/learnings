- React applications are entirely made of the components.
- Components are the building blocks of the user interfaces in React.
- Piece of UI that has its own logic, data and appearance (how it works & looks).
- We build complex UI by building multiple components and combining them.
- Components can be reused, nested inside each other and pass data between them.
