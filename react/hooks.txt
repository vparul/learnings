⚙️ What Are Hooks?

Hooks are special functions introduced in React 16.8 that let you use state and other React features (like lifecycle methods) without writing a class.
Examples:

useState() → state management
useEffect() → side effects (like fetching data or updating the DOM)
useContext(), useRef(), useMemo(), useCallback(), etc.

🌟 Benefits of Using Hooks
1. 🧠 Simpler, More Readable Code
Hooks let you manage state and logic directly inside functional components — no need for verbose class components, constructors, or this.

2. 🔁 Reuse Stateful Logic Easily
Hooks make it easy to share logic between components using custom hooks — without changing the component hierarchy or using higher-order components.

📜 The Rules of Hooks

React enforces two key rules to make sure Hooks work properly:

Rule 1: Only Call Hooks at the Top Level
Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
Always call them at the top level of your React function.
Why?
React relies on the order of Hooks to track state across renders.
Changing that order breaks the mapping.

Rule 2: Only Call Hooks from React Functions

Call Hooks only inside:
React functional components
Custom Hooks (functions whose names start with use)

🛠️ React Enforces These Rules
If you use ESLint, you can add this rule to automatically catch violations:
npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev
