There are 2 options for setting react project
1. create-react-app

- This is a starter kit for building reaact applications.
- Major things are pre configured like ESlint, Prettier, Jest etc.
- It uses slow and outdated technologies (webpack) for bundling, hence not recommended to use for real world applications now. You still can use it for self learning projects

2. Vite
- This is a build tool that have template for setting the react application.
- You have to manually add ESlint configuration etc.
- Uses fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and bundling, hence, now recommended for real world applications



                                              HOT MODULE REPLACEMENT (HMR) - 
HMR is teh development feature that let you see the code changes instantly without reloading the entire application.


how HMR actually “knows” what changed and how it updates the browser without a full reload.

🧠 Step 1: File Change Detection (Dev Server)

- When you run a dev server (e.g., with Vite or Webpack), it watches the file system.
- You save a file (e.g., Button.jsx).
- The dev server detects this change instantly (via fs.watch or a watcher like chokidar).
- It rebuilds only that module instead of the entire project.

👉 So, the server already knows which module changed.

🔁 Step 2: Module Graph & Dependency Tracking
Modern bundlers maintain a module graph — basically a map of:
Which files (modules) depend on which others.
What imports/exports they expose.

Example:
App.jsx → imports Button.jsx
         → imports Header.jsx


If Button.jsx changes:
 - The bundler looks up the graph.
 -Finds all modules that depend on it.
 - Marks only those as “affected.”

📡 Step 3: Sending the Update to Browser (WebSocket)
The dev server communicates with the browser through a WebSocket connection.
When it detects a change, it sends a small message like in JSON format:

{
  "type": "update",
  "updates": [
    {
      "path": "/src/Button.jsx",
      "timestamp": 16999999999
    }
  ]
}


No full reload, just a signal that says “this module changed.”

🧭 Step 4: HMR Runtime on the Browser
The browser has a small HMR runtime script injected by the bundler.
This script listens for update messages from the dev server.
When it receives one, it:
Fetches the updated module (e.g., new compiled JS for Button.jsx),
Executes it in place without reloading the page,
Replaces the old module in the module graph,
Notifies any dependent modules if needed.

👉 That’s why your screen updates instantly — it’s just replacing a JS chunk, not reloading everything.
