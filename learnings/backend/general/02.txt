// STATUS CODES
// Status codes are important because they tells the whether the request sent to the server is successful or failed . This is important
because we want to know  what's the status of the request we send to the server .
So, when the server responsd to the request, it sends back the response along with the status code 

Classification of the status code - 
The first digit of the status code defines the class of the response while the last two does not have any role in the categorisation

1. 1xx (Informational) 
Means the request was received and is still being processed

2. 2xx (successful) 

200 OK - This is the successful http request
201 Created - This status code is used when you create anything on the server and the resource is created
204 No Content - Server has successfully fulfilled the request but there was no represenattion \

3. 3xx (Redirection)
301 (Moved Permanently) - 
The resource (page, file, or endpoint) has been permanently moved to a new location (new URL).
Any future requests should use the new URL instead of the old one.

Example in action
Suppose your site had a blog post at:
https://example.com/old-blog-post

But you’ve now moved it to:
https://example.com/new-blog-post


If someone tries to visit the old link, the server responds:
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://example.com/new-blog-post


👉 The browser (or Google) will automatically go to the new URL.

4. 4xx (Client Error)
400 Bad Request - The server cannot process the request because it’s malformed (syntax error, invalid data).
401 Unauthorised - Authentication is required but either not provided or invalid.
Example: API call without a valid token.

403 – Forbidden
The request was understood, authentication may be valid, but the user does not have permission.
Example: A normal user trying to access an admin-only page.

404 – Not Found
The server can’t find the requested resource.
Example: Broken links or mistyped URLs.

405 - Method Not Allowed
The server does understand the method, but it’s not allowed for this resource.

5. 5xx (Server Error)
501 – Not Implemented
The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
Example: The client tries to use a method like PATCH but the server only supports GET and POST


503 – Service Unavailable
The server is temporarily unable to handle the request (overloaded, down for maintenance).
Usually temporary — try again later.

501 vs 405

501 – Not Implemented
Meaning: The server doesn’t recognize or support the request method (or functionality).
It basically says: “I don’t even know how to handle this kind of request.”

Example:
You send PATCH, but the server doesn’t understand PATCH at all.

🔹 405 – Method Not Allowed
Meaning: The server does understand the method, but it’s not allowed for this resource.

Example:
The server supports POST, but you tried to POST on a read-only resource that only allows GET.
API endpoint /users might allow GET and POST, but not DELETE. If you try DELETE /users, you’ll get 405.
Example: The server supports DELETE, but you can’t DELETE /users (maybe only GET is allowed there).

✅ Key difference:
501 → The server doesn’t support this method at all.
405 → The method is supported generally, but not for this particular resource.

👉 Think of it like:
501 = “Sorry, I don’t know this method.”
405 = “I know this method, but you can’t use it here.”
